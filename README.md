# ICU4j JAR Library

This Oxygen XML Editor plugin provides the entire ICU4J JAR library used for sorting and collations with XSLT processors.

For example, the Saxon 9 XSLT processor has an *xsl:sort* element that can be used to sort elements based on their text content:

            <xsl:for-each select="/*/*">
                <xsl:sort select="." collation="http://www.w3.org/2013/collation/UCA?lang=ta"/> 
                <xsl:copy-of select="."/>
            </xsl:for-each>
            
If the XML elements contain texts in exotic languages, Saxon needs a more powerful sort algorithm and the ICU4J library provides this extra support.
